# HA Automation Visualizer

HA Automation Visualizer is a small showcase project born from experimenting with OpenAI Codex. Its aim is to make Home Assistant automations easy to share. Each YAML automation is grouped into a category so the collection can grow into a helpful library for any smart home.

Most of the code has been generated by OpenAI Codex with only minor manual tweaks. The project is open source and you are welcome to reuse or adapt the code. A live demo is available on [GitHub Pages](https://lkn94.github.io/ha-automation-visualizer/).

## How it works

- Automations are stored in `public/automations/`.
- When the app loads, the YAML files are fetched and parsed with `js-yaml`.
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) renders the automations as flow charts.
- The front end uses React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS via Vite.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

After making changes you can create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Use `npm run preview` to test the built site locally.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Ensure the base path in `vite.config.ts` is correct:

   ```ts
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/ha-automation-visualizer/',
   });
   ```

2. Push your changes to the `main` branch. A GitHub Actions workflow will build the site and publish the contents of the `dist` folder to `gh-pages`.

3. To verify the result locally, run:

   ```bash
   npx serve dist
   ```

GitHub Pages then serves the static site from the `gh-pages` branch.
